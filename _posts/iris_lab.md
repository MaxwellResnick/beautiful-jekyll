Which species of iris has the longest petals (on average)?

I found the species of iris with the longest petals to be virginica, with a length of 5.552.

Which species of iris has the widest sepals (on average)?

I found the species of iris with the widest sepals to be setosa, with a width of 3.418.

Describe your process in finding these answers. Include details such as who you worked with, what methods you tried, what worked or didnâ€™t work, what could have gone better, and what you learned during this lab. Feel free to attach images, screenshots, pseudocode, etc to elaborate on your response!

In order to find these answers, I had to analyze the Iris data to determine the species with the longest average petal and the widest average sepal. First, I had to import the csv file. Then, I had to initialize the lists and dictionaries that would allow me to determine the average lengths and withs. After I did that, I ran a for loop that would read the CSV file. Then, I put the lists in dictionaries, which allowed me to find the averages in the next block of code. Finally, I printed all the values which gave me the averages that I needed.

Initially in this lab, I struggled apply my knowledge of dictionaries and lists to this particular project. I understood everything in theory, but the application was difficult. However, I soon became more familiar by trying different code blocks and seeing what worked. I used trial and error a lot while doing this lab. In this lab, I learned how to analyze a CSV file. I found this very helpful because I am very interested in data, and now I am closer to being able to perform projects on my own in python. While working on this lab, I discussed certain strategies with Jake Federman. However, we did not share any code, but rather just ideas.
