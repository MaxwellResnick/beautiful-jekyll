# My Computer Science and Math Experience

During my sophomore year of high school, I took Introduction to Computer Science. I enjoyed it a lot, so I decided to expand my knowledge on the subject. Two summers ago, I attended the Wharton Moneyball Academy which gave me an introduction to statistics and computer science through the lens of sports. I loved it so much, that I decided to take Computer Science II last year. I am currently in AP Calculus AB. While Moneyball was an informal statistics class, I took an Introduction to Quantitative Methods course at Harvard Summer School. I love computer science and statistics and I hope to pursue both areas of study in college and beyond.

# My Hobbies

I am an avid sports fan. I love baseball, basketball, hockey, football, and tennis. While I only play baseball, I love to follow those sports. I love sports analytics a lot too. Sports analytics is the intersection of data science and sports. I love to perform my own projects and I entered a sports datathon last year. Currently, my favorite baseball player is Ronald Acuña Jr. (pictured below). I also love the Houston Rockets and New York Islanders. Overall, I just love sports in general, and the analysis that comes with it.

# What I'm Looking Forward to

I am looking forward to hopefully having a somewhat-normal senior year. While this year is all but normal, I hope to be in person for the entire second semester. Hopefully, traditional senior events like prom and graduation won’t be canceled. I also hope to spend a lot of time with my friends. My time at Horace Mann has passed by very quickly, so I hope to make the most of the time I have left. Last but not least, I hope to learn a lot in my classes. Since I am a senior, I have a lot more freedom regarding class selection. I was able to tailor my schedule around my interests this year, so I’m hoping everything goes well!
